If you leave the parameter thing aside the ›Master-Mode‹ is technically really simple to implement… the hardest thing is to code the interface for it ;)

feel free to implement it anywhere ^^

PS: its really only a more detailed sketch, so i didn’t calculated the right values in the distribution column, etc. …
