Interpolation Interface 
===========


![Interpolation Interface](InterpolationInterface_01.png)
If you leave the parameter thing aside the ›Master-Mode‹ is technically really simple to implement… the hardest thing is to code the interface for it ;) 
(even though simple ›parameters‹ as spacing, kerning, x-Interpolation, y-Interpolation would be quite easy to implement as well) 


And something for the future with ufo3 and ›metapolater-like‹ tools

this one is better (technically inspired by Tim Ahrens RMX Scaler):

feel free to implement it anywhere, without restrictions :) (even though it would nice to get mentioned)

PS: it’s really only a more detailed sketch, so i didn’t calculated the right values in the distribution column, etc. …
