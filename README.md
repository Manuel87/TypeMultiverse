Interpolation Interface 
===========

NOTE TO MYSELF: really have to upload another example. the interpolation technique used in the first example totally lacks control. much better is a interpolation with (infinite) master axes and one reference master all others are relating to.

If you leave the parameter thing aside the ›Master-Mode‹ is technically really simple to implement… the hardest thing is to code the interface for it ;) 
(even though simple ›parameters‹ as spacing, kerning, x-Interpolation, y-Interpolation would be quite easy to implement as well) 


And something for the future with ufo3 and ›metapolater-like‹ tools (specific example is inspired by Tim Ahrens RMX Scaler):

feel free to implement it anywhere, without restrictions :) (even though it would nice to get mentioned)

PS: it’s really only a more detailed sketch, so i didn’t calculated the right values in the distribution column, etc. …
